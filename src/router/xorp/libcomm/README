This directory contains the COMM socket library.

This library includes a number of handy functions that simplify the
usage of communication sockets: open, close, bind to a local address and
a port, join a multicast group, etc.  The library supports both IPv4 and
IPv6.

The complete API to the library is in the "comm_api.h" file.
Each function declared in that file is reasonably well documented.

The API has two parts: the high-level ``user'' API, and the lower-lever
``sock'' API.
The lower-level API performs the particular operations on a socket
(e.g., join a multicast group on a socket).
The higher-level API usually combines several lower-level operations
together: e.g., open a socket, bind it to a multicast address and a port,
and join that multicast address.

See file test_comm.c for various examples of how to use the library.
