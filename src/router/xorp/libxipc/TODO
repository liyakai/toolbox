Any of these items are up for grabs.  Before embarking on them send a
note to the developers list to check they are not covered by work in
progress.

* Add support for pipelining in XRL protocol families.

* Add support for handling one-to-many resolutions at client end, ie
  implement a standard policy mechanism or have hooks for generic
  policies.

* Rework the XRL parser related routines to make them more akin to the
  parsing capabilities of the python scripts used to generate XRL
  interfaces.

* Copy minimization in existing protocol families.  There are a few
  unnecessary copies that should be eliminated.  This may be
  straightforward.  We might also want to consider using reference
  counted XrlAtoms.

* Implement additional protocol families (signals, UNIX domain
  sockets, XXX Your IPC mechanism here XXX).
