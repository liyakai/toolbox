* How do we ad the varmap ?

* What happens if Source match is up, but export is not!!!!!!

* rip v6/v4 are different processes... rib will send route to any process...
  dunno

* Sets: escape comma escape quote in instructions etc.

* bgp check if route going through pipeline before doing a policy push

* push route races... e.g stuff going from X->Y will cause X and Y to push, so
  same route may be "added" from X and repushed from Y inside of Y. May cause
  problems.
