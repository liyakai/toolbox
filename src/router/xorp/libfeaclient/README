This directory contains code that may be useful to clients of the FEA.

The goal is to mirror the FEA interface configuration state across
routing processes, the RIB, and any other interested parties.

The FEA interface configuration state structures are defined in
ifmgr_atoms.{hh,cc}.  The key classes are:

   IfMgrIfTree - container of interfaces

   IfMgrIfAtom - representation of individual interface state and
	         container of the interface's virtual interfaces.

   IfMgrVifAtom - representation of virtual interface state and
		  container of addresses associated with the virtual
		  interface.

   IfMgrIPv4Atom - representation of IPv4 address state on a virtual
		   interface.

   IfMgrIPv6Atom - representation of IPv6 address state on a virtual
		   interface.

Each of these classes has a set of accessor and modifier methods.

To assist with the remote synchronization, modification of these
classes is intended to occur using a set of configuration command
classes defined in ifmgr_cmds.{hh,cc}.  These have two methods:
execute and forward.  The execute method applies a modification
operation to an item within an IfMgrIfTree structure.  The forward
method sends an XRL towards a remote target.  The remote target will
receive the XRL and fix up it's configuration tree accordingly.
